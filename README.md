This is my own portfolio based on the NextJS framework.

## Requirement

Setup the right npm version to run the project.
Make sure to have [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) on your machine.
Then, do `nvm use` on the root of the project.

After this, install the dependecies with `npm i`

Create a .env file based on the exemple.

## Start the project

To start the project locally, simply run `npm run dev`. Make sure that the HeadlessCMS server is also up and running.
